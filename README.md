# üìö Database Management System (DBMS) Topics

## üìò Core Concepts

### Introduction to DBMS

* **Definition**: A DBMS is a software system that allows creation, management, and use of databases.
* **Purpose**: To provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient.
* **Examples of DBMS**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB

### Database vs. File System

* **Key Differences**

| Feature                 | File System                                           | Database (DBMS)                                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Storage**        | Stores data in files (e.g., .txt, .csv)               | Stores data in structured tables                           |
| **Data Redundancy**     | High ‚Äî same data may be stored in multiple files      | Low ‚Äî uses normalization to reduce redundancy              |
| **Data Access**         | Manual or through custom programs                     | Accessed using SQL queries                                 |
| **Data Integrity**      | Hard to enforce                                       | Built-in constraints (e.g., primary & foreign keys)        |
| **Security**            | Basic file-level protection                           | Role-based access control and permissions                  |
| **Backup & Recovery**   | Manual and error-prone                                | Automated with recovery support                            |
| **Concurrency Control** | Difficult ‚Äî prone to conflicts in multi-user settings | Supports concurrent access and ACID properties             |
| **Relationships**       | Not supported                                         | Supports relational data through table joins and keys      |
| **Data Consistency**    | Difficult to maintain across files                    | High consistency maintained through transaction management |
| **Scalability**         | Limited for large or complex datasets                 | Designed for large-scale applications                      |

> ‚úÖ **Conclusion:**
> Use **File System** for simple, small-scale tasks.
> Use **DBMS** for secure, consistent, and multi-user applications.

### Types of DBMS (Hierarchical, Network, Relational, NoSQL)

| Type                  | Structure                    | Key Features                                                 | Examples                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Hierarchical DBMS** | Tree (one-to-many)           | Data organized in parent-child relationships                 | IBM IMS                               |
| **Network DBMS**      | Graph (many-to-many)         | Allows complex relationships; children can have many parents | IDS, TurboIMAGE                       |
| **Relational DBMS**   | Tables (rows and columns)    | Data stored in normalized tables; uses SQL                   | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server |
| **NoSQL DBMS**        | Key-Value / Document / Graph | Schema-less; handles unstructured/semi-structured data       | MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Neo4j      |

> üìú **Note:**
>
> * **RDBMS** is suitable for structured data and strong consistency.
> * **NoSQL** is ideal for scalability and flexible schema requirements.

### DBMS Architecture (1-tier, 2-tier, 3-tier)

| Architecture Type | Description                                                          | Layers Involved                               | Example Use Case                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **1-Tier**        | The database and user interface run on the same machine              | DBMS + User directly on the same system       | Local personal DBMS (e.g., MS Access)         |
| **2-Tier**        | The application communicates directly with the database server       | Client + Database Server                      | Small client-server apps (e.g., desktop apps) |
| **3-Tier**        | Adds a middle layer between client and database for logic separation | Client + Application Server + Database Server | Web applications (frontend, backend, DB)      |

> üìå **Key Benefits of 3-Tier Architecture**
>
> * Better scalability and maintainability
> * Improved security and performance
> * Separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data layer

## ü•â Database Design

### Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

* Visually represents the relationships between different entities in a database.

**What is Entity?**

* Represents a real-world object or concept that can have data stored about it. (table)
* Example: A "Student" in a school database or a "Product" in an e-commerce database.

**What is Attribute?**

* Attributes provide more information about an entity.
* Example: The "Student" entity might have attributes like "Name", "Age", and "Enrollment Number".

**What is Relationship?**

* Represents an association between two or more entities.
* Example: A "Student" enrolls in a "Course".

**What is Key?**

* Used to uniquely identify rows (records) in a table.

**Types of Keys:**

* **Primary Key**: Cannot be NULL and must be unique. Example: student\_id.
* **Candidate Key**: Field(s) that could be a primary key. Example: email, username.
* **Alternate Key**: Candidate keys not chosen as primary. Example: username if email is primary.
* **Composite Key**: Two or more attributes together. Example: student\_id + course\_id.
* **Foreign Key**: Refers to primary key in another table.
* **Super Key**: Any combination of columns that uniquely identifies a row.

**What is Cardinality?**

* Defines the number of instances of one entity related to another entity.

**Types of Cardinality:**

* One-to-One (1:1)
* One-to-Many (1\:M)
* Many-to-Many (M\:N)

**ER Diagrams (Entity Relation Diagrams)**

* Graphical representation showing entities, attributes, and relationships.

### Mapping ER Model to Relational Model

* Converts ER model components to relational schema (tables, keys).

### Relational Model Concepts

* Focuses on tables (relations), rows (tuples), and columns (attributes).

### Schema and Instance

* **Schema**: Blueprint/structure of database.

```sql
Student(StudentID INT, Name VARCHAR(50), Age INT)
```

* **Instance**: Actual data in the table at a moment.

| StudentID | Name    | Age |
| --------- | ------- | --- |
| 1         | Asraful | 22  |
| 2         | Riya    | 21  |
| 3         | Karim   | 23  |
