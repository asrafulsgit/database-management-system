# üìö Database Management System (DBMS) Topics

## üìò Core Concepts

* Introduction to DBMS

  * **Definition:** A DBMS is a software system that allows creation, management, and use of databases.
  * **Purpose:** To provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient.
  * **Examples of DBMS:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB

* Database vs. File System

  * **Key Differences**

  | Feature                 | File System                                           | Database (DBMS)                                            |
  | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **Data Storage**        | Stores data in files (e.g., .txt, .csv)               | Stores data in structured tables                           |
  | **Data Redundancy**     | High ‚Äî same data may be stored in multiple files      | Low ‚Äî uses normalization to reduce redundancy              |
  | **Data Access**         | Manual or through custom programs                     | Accessed using SQL queries                                 |
  | **Data Integrity**      | Hard to enforce                                       | Built-in constraints (e.g., primary & foreign keys)        |
  | **Security**            | Basic file-level protection                           | Role-based access control and permissions                  |
  | **Backup & Recovery**   | Manual and error-prone                                | Automated with recovery support                            |
  | **Concurrency Control** | Difficult ‚Äî prone to conflicts in multi-user settings | Supports concurrent access and ACID properties             |
  | **Relationships**       | Not supported                                         | Supports relational data through table joins and keys      |
  | **Data Consistency**    | Difficult to maintain across files                    | High consistency maintained through transaction management |
  | **Scalability**         | Limited for large or complex datasets                 | Designed for large-scale applications                      |

  > ‚úÖ **Conclusion:**
  > Use **File System** for simple, small-scale tasks.
  > Use **DBMS** for secure, consistent, and multi-user applications.

* Types of DBMS (Hierarchical, Network, Relational, NoSQL)

  | Type                  | Structure                    | Key Features                                                 | Examples                              |
  | --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
  | **Hierarchical DBMS** | Tree (one-to-many)           | Data organized in parent-child relationships                 | IBM IMS                               |
  | **Network DBMS**      | Graph (many-to-many)         | Allows complex relationships; children can have many parents | IDS, TurboIMAGE                       |
  | **Relational DBMS**   | Tables (rows and columns)    | Data stored in normalized tables; uses SQL                   | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server |
  | **NoSQL DBMS**        | Key-Value / Document / Graph | Schema-less; handles unstructured/semi-structured data       | MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Neo4j      |

  > üìù **Note:**
  >
  > * **RDBMS** is suitable for structured data and strong consistency.
  > * **NoSQL** is ideal for scalability and flexible schema requirements.

* DBMS Architecture (1-tier, 2-tier, 3-tier)

  | Architecture Type | Description                                                          | Layers Involved                               | Example Use Case                              |
  | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
  | **1-Tier**        | The database and user interface run on the same machine              | DBMS + User directly on the same system       | Local personal DBMS (e.g., MS Access)         |
  | **2-Tier**        | The application communicates directly with the database server       | Client + Database Server                      | Small client-server apps (e.g., desktop apps) |
  | **3-Tier**        | Adds a middle layer between client and database for logic separation | Client + Application Server + Database Server | Web applications (frontend, backend, DB)      |

  > üìå **Key Benefits of 3-Tier Architecture**
  >
  > * Better scalability and maintainability
  > * Improved security and performance
  > * Separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data layer

## üß© Database Design

* Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

  * It visually represents the relationships between different entities in a database. It is widely used in database design to help define the structure before creating the actual database.

  **What is Entity?**

  * An entity represents a real-world object or concept that can have data stored about it. (table)
  * Example: A "Student" in a school database or a "Product" in an e-commerce database.

  **What is Attribute?**

  * Attributes provide more information about an entity. Each entity has a set of attributes that describe its characteristics.
  * Example: The "Student" entity might have attributes like "Name", "Age", and "Enrollment Number".

  **What is Relationship?**

  * A relationship represents an association between two or more entities.
  * Example: A "Student" enrolls in a "Course". The relationship here is "enrolls", which connects "Student" and "Course".

  **What is Key?**

  * A key is an attribute (or set of attributes) that is used to uniquely identify rows (records) in a table. Keys ensure that data in the table remains unique, accurate, and linked across related tables.

  **Types of Keys:**

  * **Primary Key:**

    * Cannot be NULL and must be unique.
    * Example: student\_id in a Students table.

  * **Candidate Key:**

    * A field (or combination of fields) that can qualify as a primary key.
    * There can be multiple candidate keys in one table.
    * One of them is chosen as the primary key.
    * Example: email and username in a Users table can both be candidate keys.

  * **Alternate Key:**

    * Candidate keys that were not chosen as the primary key.
    * Example: If email is chosen as the primary key, then username becomes an alternate key.

  * **Composite Key:**

    * A key that is made up of two or more attributes to uniquely identify a record.
    * Example: In an Enrollment table, student\_id + course\_id could form a composite key.

  * **Foreign Key:**

    * A field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table.
    * It creates a relationship between two tables.
    * Example: student\_id in Enrollments table refers to student\_id in Students table.

  * **Super Key:**

    * Any combination of columns that uniquely identifies a row.
    * Every primary key is a super key, but not every super key is a primary key.
    * Example: student\_id, or student\_id + email both are super keys if they uniquely identify records.

  **What is Cardinality?**

  * Cardinality defines the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with instances of another entity.

  **Types of Cardinality:**

  * One-to-One (1:1): One record in the first entity is associated with exactly one record in the second entity.
  * One-to-Many (1\:M): One record in the first entity can be associated with multiple records in the second entity.
  * Many-to-Many (M\:N): Multiple records in the first entity can be associated with multiple records in the second entity.

  **ER Diagrams (ER- Entity Relation)**

  * An ER diagram is a graphical representation of the ER model, showing entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

  **Mapping ER Model to Relational Model**

  **Relational Model Concepts**

  **Schema and Instance**

  * **Schema:**

    * Definition: Schema is the blueprint or structure of a database. It defines how the data is organized and how the relationships between data are handled.
    * Example:

    ```
    Student(StudentID INT, Name VARCHAR(50), Age INT)
    ```

    This tells us the table has 3 columns: StudentID, Name, and Age.

  * **Instance:**

    * Definition: Instance is the actual content or data stored in the database at a particular moment.
    * Example: 
      | StudentID | Name     | Age |
      |-----------|----------|-----|
      | 1         | Asraful  | 22  |
      | 2         | Riya     | 21  |
      | 3         | Karim    | 23  |
   This table content is the instance ‚Äî the current data inside the table.

# üìê Normalization

**Database Normalization** is the process of structuring a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves decomposing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them using a series of **normal forms**.

---

## üîó Functional Dependency

A **functional dependency** occurs when one attribute uniquely determines another attribute.

**Notation:** `A ‚Üí B` means B is functionally dependent on A.

**Example:**

| StudentID | StudentName |
|-----------|-------------|
| 101       | Alice       |
| 102       | Bob         |

Here, `StudentID ‚Üí StudentName`

---

## üìò First Normal Form (1NF)

A table is in **1NF** if:

- All attributes contain only atomic (indivisible) values.
- Each record is unique.
- No repeating groups or arrays.

‚ùå **Not in 1NF:**

| StudentID | Name  | Courses           |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| 101       | Alice | Math, Physics     |
| 102       | Bob   | English, History  |

‚úÖ **In 1NF (after fixing):**

| StudentID | Name  | Course    |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 101       | Alice | Math      |
| 101       | Alice | Physics   |
| 102       | Bob   | English   |
| 102       | Bob   | History   |

---

## üìô Second Normal Form (2NF)

A table is in **2NF** if:

- It is in 1NF.
- All non-key attributes are **fully functionally dependent** on the entire primary key.

**‚ùå Not in 2NF (Partial dependency):**

| StudentID | CourseID | StudentName | CourseName |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 101       | C01      | Alice       | Math       |
| 102       | C02      | Bob         | English    |

Here, `StudentName` depends only on `StudentID`, and `CourseName` only on `CourseID`.

‚úÖ **Split into two tables:**

**Students Table:**

| StudentID | StudentName |
|-----------|-------------|
| 101       | Alice       |
| 102       | Bob         |

**Courses Table:**

| CourseID | CourseName |
|----------|------------|
| C01      | Math       |
| C02      | English    |

**Enrollment Table:**

| StudentID | CourseID |
|-----------|----------|
| 101       | C01      |
| 102       | C02      |

---

## üìó Third Normal Form (3NF)

A table is in **3NF** if:

- It is in 2NF.
- There are **no transitive dependencies**.

**‚ùå Not in 3NF:**

| StudentID | StudentName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| 101       | Alice       | D01          | Computer Science |
| 102       | Bob         | D02          | Literature       |

Here, `DepartmentName` is dependent on `DepartmentID`, not directly on `StudentID`.

‚úÖ **Split into:**

**Students Table:**

| StudentID | StudentName | DepartmentID |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| 101       | Alice       | D01          |
| 102       | Bob         | D02          |

**Departments Table:**

| DepartmentID | DepartmentName     |
|--------------|--------------------|
| D01          | Computer Science   |
| D02          | Literature         |

---

## üìò Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

A table is in **BCNF** if:

- For every non-trivial functional dependency `X ‚Üí Y`, X is a super key.

**‚ùå Not in BCNF:**

| Teacher | Subject | Room |
|---------|---------|------|
| Alice   | Math    | 101  |
| Bob     | Math    | 101  |

Assume:
- `Teacher ‚Üí Subject`
- `Room ‚Üí Subject`

Neither `Teacher` nor `Room` is a super key.

‚úÖ **Decompose into:**

**Teacher_Subject Table:**

| Teacher | Subject |
|---------|---------|
| Alice   | Math    |
| Bob     | Math    |

**Room_Subject Table:**

| Room | Subject |
|------|---------|
| 101  | Math    |

---

## üîÅ Multivalued Dependency (4NF)

A **multivalued dependency** exists when one attribute is independent of another, but both depend on the same key.

**‚ùå Not in 4NF:**

| Employee | Skill     | Language  |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| John     | Python    | English   |
| John     | Java      | English   |
| John     | Python    | Spanish   |
| John     | Java      | Spanish   |

‚úÖ **Split into:**

**Employee_Skill Table:**

| Employee | Skill  |
|----------|--------|
| John     | Python |
| John     | Java   |

**Employee_Language Table:**

| Employee | Language |
|----------|----------|
| John     | English  |
| John     | Spanish  |

---

## üîó Join Dependency (5NF)

A **join dependency** exists when a table can be split into multiple tables and then recombined (joined) to recreate the original without loss of data.

Used in advanced normalization where there are complex many-to-many relationships.

---

## üß© Denormalization

**Denormalization** is the process of adding redundancy to improve read performance at the cost of update complexity.

**Example:**

Instead of joining multiple tables:

| OrderID | CustomerName | ProductName | Price |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| 501     | Alice        | Shirt       | $20   |

‚úÖ Reduces query time but introduces redundancy (e.g., if Alice changes her name, multiple rows must be updated).

---

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Normal Form | Key Condition                                       |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1NF         | Atomic values, no repeating groups                  |
| 2NF         | 1NF + No partial dependencies                       |
| 3NF         | 2NF + No transitive dependencies                    |
| BCNF        | Every determinant is a super key                    |
| 4NF         | No multivalued dependencies                         |
| 5NF         | No join dependencies                                |

- `BEGIN`
- `COMMIT`
- `ROLLBACK`
- `SAVEPOINT`

‚úÖ **Example Transaction:**
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;

FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

---

## üß† Subqueries & Nested Queries

A subquery is a query within another query, useful for filtering or deriving data.

‚úÖ **Subquery in WHERE clause:**
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID = (
  SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE DepartmentName = 'HR'
);
```

‚úÖ **Subquery in FROM clause:**
```sql
